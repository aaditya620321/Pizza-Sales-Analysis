# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis with MySQL

## 📌 Project Overview

**Pizza Sales Analysis** is a SQL-based data analytics project designed to extract meaningful insights from the sales data of a fictional pizza restaurant — **Pizza Resto**.  
Using MySQL, this project tackles complex joins, time-series aggregations, and query optimizations to answer key business questions about performance, trends, and revenue.

## 📂 Dataset Description

The analysis is based on multiple interrelated CSV files simulating a real-world relational database:

- `orders.csv` – Contains order ID, order date, and time.
- `order_details.csv` – Links each order to specific pizzas and quantities.
- `pizzas.csv` – Holds pizza names, sizes, and prices.
- `pizza_types.csv` – Includes pizza categories and ingredients.

These datasets support foreign key relationships and are ideal for SQL JOIN operations and time-based analysis.
